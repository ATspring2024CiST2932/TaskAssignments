Seth, thank you for the MySQL setup.
I'm working on a script that connects to a database called Demo. The script can read and query data; we need the other functions for creating, updating, and deleting records. I stopped yesterday after trying to implement a drag-and-drop feature in FE_TaskAssignments/pages/api/assign-mentee.js, and I've commented out the Unassigned Mentors in the list view in FE_TaskAssignments/pages/MentorsList.js for now. It's a bit too ambitious, so I need to scale it down. Please take a look at it.
In the meantime, Alex and Edwin, can you collaborate to add methods to the lists to add, remove, and update items? Aniyah, there should be enough there to play around with as you familiarize.
